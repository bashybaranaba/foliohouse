# Foliohouse

## Project Description
Foliohouse is a decentralized dataset repository that provides access control and a built-in token economy to incentivize the contribution of quality datasets and cover the cost of storage

### Project Background and Problem statement
Datasets provide the foundation for data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The availability and accessibility of high-quality datasets are crucial for research, development, and innovation. Without high-quality datasets, it would be impossible to train models to make predictions and to analyze and draw meaningful conclusions from the data around us. However, creating, storing, and maintaining high-quality datasets is a resource-intensive process, and there are inadequate incentives to make them accessible.This project leverages the Filecoion VM and IPFS Web3 storage to create a decentralized dataset repository that provides access control and a built-in token economy to incentivize contributions and cover the cost of storage.

### Live Prototype

### Key Features
#### Built-in Token Economy
Dataset creators earn tokens each time their datasets are used which can be used to cover storage costs on the platform
#### Access control
The platfrom gives dataset creators the ability to control who can view, access, load and use their datasets
#### Dataset Loader
The dataset loader downloads and prepares datasets for inspection and ML model evaluation and training in a standard format.

## Key Technologied Used
#### Next js
A popular open-source framework for building server-rendered React applications that enables developers to build highly performant and scalable web applications by providing a set of powerful features and optimizations out-of-the-box.
#### Filecoin VM
A runtime environment for smart contracts  on the Filecoin network that brings user programmability to Filecoin, unleashing the enormous potential of an open data economy.
#### Web3 Storage
A service that stores data redundantly across multiple Filecoin miners and the public IPFS network, provides information about where the data is stored, and retrieves data by CID.
