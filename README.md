# Foliohouse

## Project Description
Foliohouse is a decentralized dataset repository that provides access control and a built-in token economy to incentivize the contribution of quality datasets and cover the cost of storage

### Project Background and Problem statement
Datasets provide the foundation for data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The availability and accessibility of high-quality datasets are crucial for research, development, and innovation. Without high-quality datasets, it would be impossible to train models to make predictions and to analyze and draw meaningful conclusions from the data around us. However, creating, storing, and maintaining high-quality datasets is a resource-intensive process, and there are inadequate incentives to make them accessible.

This project leverages the Filecoion VM and IPFS Web3 storage to create a decentralized dataset repository that provides access control and a built-in token economy to incentivize contributions and cover the cost of storage.
